# Discover Poetry

Frontend for the [poetryDB](https://github.com/thundercomb/poetrydb) using Vanilla JS

Features:

- Sort by length of the poem
- Pagination
- Fetch data using two API endpoints

Areas for improvement:

- Data flow needs improvement (e.g: currentData state being mutated globally)
  - Implementing a store would be a fun approach
- JSDOC comments rather than what is currently commented
- Formatting poem text so the line breaks appear typically indicated by a `,` character
- Pagination could have be implemented with a class
